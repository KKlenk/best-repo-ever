Looks like I'm synced pretty good with GIT.  Github.

kjameson-ltm:best-repo-ever kjameson git status
On branch myfeaturebranch
Changes not staged for commit:
      (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
      (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
   modified: README.md
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
not sure I"m doing this right
